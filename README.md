Hello. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves modify the code in Test2.java. 

Your tasks are:

Sort the List using the 3 methods described in our lesson:
1.) The old, common way
2.) Using Collections sort.
3.) Using a Comparator.

And in all 3 ways, you should be able to sort via, String(firstName, lastName) and Number(age, height, weight).
Also, you should be able to sort via hierachy, i.e., lastName first, then firstName, then age.

Then, add a custom class inside Person, doesn't matter what, and then have it sort by that object itself.

And lastly, you should be able to only print Persons who have the same name as someone else in the list, either first Name or last Name.

If you have any questions, please skype them to me.
